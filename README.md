## SPVS Stages:
The stages described are integral to both DevSecOps and DevOps practices, with the SPVS (Software Pipeline Vulnerability Standard) enhancing each stage with security-focused guidelines:

1. **Plan**: This initial stage involves defining the scope, objectives, and security requirements of the project. In the context of SPVS, this includes assessing potential security risks, setting security baselines, and planning for security measures that align with the overall business goals.

2. **Develop/Design/Code**: At this stage, developers write code with an emphasis on incorporating security into the design from the start. The SPVS encourages the use of secure coding practices, regular code reviews, and the integration of security tools that can identify vulnerabilities early in the development process.

3. **Build/Package**: This involves compiling code into executable artifacts and ensuring that the build process includes automated security checks. Under the SPVS, this stage would emphasize the security of the build environment and the integrity of the artifacts to prevent tampering and ensure compliance with security standards.

4. **Integrate**: Integration involves merging developed features into the existing codebase. The SPVS supports this stage by advocating for automated security testing and scanning during integration to detect integration issues and vulnerabilities early, enhancing overall security.

5. **Release Ready**: At this point, the software is in its final stages before release. The SPVS ensures that the software meets all security criteria and compliance requirements, conducting final security assessments and audits to validate the readiness for deployment.

6. **Deploy**: Deployment is the process of installing the software in a live environment. According to SPVS principles, this should involve secure deployment practices to protect applications during the transition to production and minimize disruptions while maintaining security.

7. **Operate**: Operation focuses on the ongoing management of the software in production. SPVS encourages maintaining security standards through access controls, secure maintenance practices, and ensuring that operational activities uphold security integrity.

8. **Monitor**: The final stage involves continuous monitoring of the system for any security breaches or failures. SPVS would advocate for the use of real-time security monitoring tools and incident response strategies to quickly identify and mitigate threats, maintaining the security posture over time.

Together, these stages form a comprehensive lifecycle, with the SPVS ensuring that security is a cornerstone throughout the DevSecOps and DevOps processes, from planning through to monitoring.
